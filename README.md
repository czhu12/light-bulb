# ðŸ’¡ Light Bulb

Light Bulb is an labeling tool built with state of the art active learning and semi supervised learning techniques. Currently supports text classification and image classification.

## Getting Started
#### Mac OSX
```
brew install yarn
git clone https://github.com/czhu12/labelling-tool && cd labelling-tool
make
```
#### Cat / not cat demo dataset
```
make dataset/cat_not_cat # Download and set up dataset.
./bin/run config/examples/cat_not_cat.yml # Server set up on localhost:5000
```
#### Small IMDB reviews dataset
```
make dataset/small_imdb_reviews # Download and set up dataset.
./bin/run config/examples/small_imdb_reviews.yml # Server set up on localhost:5000
```

## Usage
### Configuration
Heres an example configuration:
```
task:
  title: What kind of animal is this?
  description: Select the type of animal you see, if there is none, select "Skip"
dataset:
  directory: dataset/image_classification/
  data_type: images
  judgements_file: outputs/image_multiclass_classification/labels.csv
label:
  type: classification
  classes:
    - Dog
    - Cat
    - Giraffe
    - Dolphin
    - Skip
model:
  directory: outputs/image_multiclass_classification/models/
user: chris
```

#### task
```
task:
  title: What kind of animal is this?
  description: Select the type of animal you see, if there is none, select "Skip"
```

#### dataset
```
dataset:
  directory: dataset/image_classification/
  data_type: images
  judgements_file: outputs/image_multiclass_classification/labels.csv
```
`judgements_file` defines the file that the labels are saved in.

`data_type` defines what type of model is used. Valid options are `images` and `text`

#### label
```
label:
  type: classification
  classes:
    - Dog
    - Cat
    - Giraffe
    - Dolphin
```

`type` defines the type of label, options are `classification` and `binary`.

#### model
```
model:
  directory: outputs/image_multiclass_classification/models/
```

`directory` defines where the trained model is saved.

#### user
```
user: chris
```
`user` defines who the person labeling is, which may be useful when the label's are used.

### Example Text classification
To run the text classification demo:
```
make dataset/small_imdb_reviews
./bin/run config/examples/small_imdb_reviews.yml
```

### Example Image Classification
To run the image classification demo:
```
make dataset/cat_not_cat
./bin/run config/examples/cat_not_cat.yml
```

## How It Works
### Architecture
![Encoder Decoder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czhu12/labelling-tool/master/docs/images/encoder-decoder.png)

Most deep learning tasks can be framed as a encoder - decoder architecture. For example, text classification can be framed as an LSTM encoder that outputs into a logistic regression decoder. Object detection can be framed as a ResNet encoder with a regression decoder. All models in Light Bulb are framed as an encoder - decoder architecture, and the encoder are pre-trained on an external dataset (Image Net for images, and Wikitext-103 for text), and then fine-tuned on the target dataset.

### Semi Supervised Text
![Encoder Decoder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czhu12/labelling-tool/master/docs/images/language-model.png)

Light Bulb's text encoder is a pretrained language model on [wikitext-103](https://einstein.ai/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset) (inspired by [ULMFiT](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)),  with a vocab limited to the most frequent 100k words in the corpus. The model is fine-tuned on the target dataset as a language model.

### Semi Supervised Image
![Squeeze Net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czhu12/labelling-tool/master/docs/images/squeezenet-architecture.png)

Light Bulb uses [Squeeze Net](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet) pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to encode image data. The encoder is fine-tuned on the target dataset that is given to be labeled as an auto-encoder. Standard image augmentation techniques are used to expand the labeled training set.

### Active Learning
Light Bulb will train a model as you provide training data through labeling. Light Bulb will sample items to be labeled by scoring the unlabeled items and sample the highest entropy items.

## Coming Soon
- Sequence Tagging
- Object Detection
- Sequence to Sequence Modeling
- Dockerize Application
